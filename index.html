                    Ray was an Indian director, screenwriter, documentary filmmaker, author, polymath, polyglot, essayist, lyricist, music composer, magazine
                    editor, illustrator, calligrapher, and composer. He is widely considered as one of the greatest film-makers of all time.
                    Satyajit Ray was born in Calcutta on May 2, 1921. His father, Late Sukumar Ray was an eminent poet and writer in the history of Bengali
                    literature. In 1940, after receiving his degree in science and economics from Calcutta University, he attended Tagore's Viswa-Bharati
                    University. Starting his career as a commercial artist, Ray was drawn into independent film-making after meeting French filmmaker
                    Jean Renoir and viewing Vittorio De Sica's Italian neorealist film Bicycle Thieves (1948) during a visit to London.
                    Ray directed 36 films, including feature films, documentaries, and shorts. He is well known for his contributions to Bengali literature.
                    He created two of the most famous characters in Feluda the sleuth and Professor Shanku the scientist. He wrote several short novels and
                    stories in addition to those based on these two characters. His fiction was targeted mainly at younger readers, though it became popular
                    among children and adults alike.
                    Ray designed four typefaces for roman script named Ray Roman, Ray Bizarre, Daphnis, and Holiday script, apart from numerous Bengali ones
                    for the Sandesh magazine.[113][114] Ray Roman and Ray Bizarre won an international competition in 1971. In certain circles of Calcutta,
                    Ray continued to be known as an eminent graphic designer, well into his film career. He illustrated all his books and designed covers for
                    them, as well as creating all publicity material for his films.
                    He died on 23<sup>rd</sup> April, 1992 in Kolkata, at the age of 70 due to heart and lung ailments.
